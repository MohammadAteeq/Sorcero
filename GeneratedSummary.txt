Just A Rather Very Intelligent System a.k.a JARVIS is created by Tony Stark natural-language and a
sophisticated artificial intelligence user interface computer system, named after Edwin Jarvis, the butler
who worked for Howard Stark.

Though its primary duty is to automate Starkâ€™s Malibu estate, the lifelike
program fulfills many other needs for Stark, like being an information source for him, a diagnostic tool, a
consultant and a voice of reason in Starkâ€™s life.

During the Ultron Offensive, JARVIS was destroyed
by Ultron, although his remaining programming codes unknowingly continued to thwart Ultron's plans of
gaining access to nuclear missiles.

His remains were found by Stark, who uploaded them into a synthetic
body made of vibranium and, in conjunction with Ultron's personality and an Infinity Stone.

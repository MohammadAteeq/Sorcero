# summarizer
* The main file is summary.py

* The code depends on the Universal Sentence Encoder to encode each sentence into 512 vector.
* Also I build two Objectives to capture the coverage and redundancy in the final sumary.
* I used the following libraries:
* tensorflow: Universal Sentence Encoder
* numpy
* math 
* Random
* inspyred: finding the solution for optimization problem
* nltk
